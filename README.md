# ---> Sky's The Limit! ☁
### Unity 2D Game Project made by me! ❤️


This is my first solo experience as a game developer. I've been loving it so far and hope to keep improving this game and myself as a game dev!

- This repository contains:
- The Unity project
- Build for MacOS and Windows
## About this Game:

- This is a never-ending jumping game, my biggest inspiration for this is "Sky Whale".
- The gameplay is very simple! it basically consists in jumping over some clouds and collecting some food. (There's more to be implemented in the future!)
- The player has to be careful with the uprising lava flood
- Some nice features that i've thought about are already implemented, like dashing upward by holding "space".
- That's basically it! (for now)
